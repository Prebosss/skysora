Basic flight deal tracker via webscraping project.
Scraping Kayak, but would like to update more in the future.
Only the first 15 results scraped per search.
Still trying to figure out bot-detection.
Using selenium webdriver, beautiful soup to scrape, and pandas for the data.
This is by no means perfect and may have bugs, very simplistic.

(I am using a virtual environment with selenium, chromedriver, and pytest installed, pandas, beautiful soup, airportsdata, and datetime. <-- So set this up if you want to run!)
